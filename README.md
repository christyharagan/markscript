MarkScript core library
==

Overview
--

MarkScript is a framework for building JavaScript or TypeScript projects with MarkLogic.

It's goal is to make it quick, easy, and painless for developers to build applications, including creating tests and continuous builds. Whether you are trying MarkLogic out for the first time, and just want to build a simple hello-world application, or are looking to build the next world-changing project, MarkScript allows you to focus on the core business logic.

This is the core library for MarkScript, most useful for people looking to extend the MarkScript framework itself. If you are looking to create a MarkScript project, consider the [markscript-cli](https://github.com/christyharagan/markscript-cli) project which provides a simple command line interface for creating and managing MarkScript projects. Alternatively, If you are looking for example MarkScript projects, have a look at [markscript-examples](https://github.com/christyharagan/markscript-examples).
